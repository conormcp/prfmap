These "basic models of the Spizter/IRAC Point Response Function can be downloaded from 
https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/calibrationfiles/psfprf/

They are designed for use with APEX and there are different versions for the *cryogenic* 
and *warm* phase of the Spitzer mission.
Use the central PRF (...col129_row129...) as the "mosaic PRF file".
